# Text-Based Adventure Game

## Overview

A lightweight and modular role-playing game built in C using SQLite for persistent game data management.  
Inspired by classic text adventures and *The Elder Scrolls*, this engine lets you explore dynamically generated rooms, interact with items and engage enemies.

The game is in a **playable state**, although occasional crashes might occur as itâ€™s still a work-in-progress.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Game

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have these installed:
- GCC
- Make
- SQLite3

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text-Based-RPG-Engine.git
cd Text-Based-RPG-Engine
make
./game

```

## ðŸ’¡ Things I Have Learned

- Designing a modular game architecture in C with separation of concerns.
- Managing dynamic memory safely in C for strings and custom vector structures.
- Utilizing SQLite to store and query game data such as rooms, items, and enemies.
- Implementing game loops with text parsing for flexible player input.
- Handling dynamic room generation with exits and inventory mechanics.
- Using Makefiles for compiling multi-file C projects efficiently.
- Employing string manipulation and case normalization to handle user commands robustly.

## ðŸ“„ SQLite Database Schema (Summary)

The game uses SQLite to manage persistent data with the following key tables:

- **room_templates** â€” Defines room prefixes, core names, base descriptions, and optional features.
- **item_definitions** â€” Stores all possible items with names, descriptions, and values.
- **enemy_definitions** â€” Contains enemy stats including health, attack, defense, and XP rewards.
- **room_template_items** â€” Maps which items appear in which room templates.
- **room_template_enemies** â€” Maps which enemies appear in which room templates.

This schema supports dynamic room creation with variable items and enemies to enrich gameplay.
